## Announcing Nx-plugin open-source project

Today, we are excited to announce an open-source project called [Nx-plugins](https://github.com/marksandspencer/nx-plugins).

### Introduction

Nx-Plugin is a [Nx](https://nx.dev/) mono repo which consists of plugins which supports the Nx eco-system.

Our plugins so far include:

- **nx-playwright** - An [NX plugin](https://nx.dev/packages/nx-plugin) to add support to an NX monorepo for playwright testing using a native runner.

### Why Open Source?

Adoption for Nx as a mono repo build tool has significantly increased over time. However, there is often some extra configuration work required in order to use external libraries/tools.

While working on an internal project where we were using Playwright for end-to-end testing, some manual configuration was required to integrate Playwright with Nx.

The team within M&S has come up with an internal project to create a plugin which simplifies integration of Nx with Playwright.

With a successful implementation of the nx-plugins project, the team at M&S decided to open-source it to allow the community to benefit from it and contribute to it.
